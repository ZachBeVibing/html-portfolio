<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hey! I'm a developer in the process of learning many things. I currently go to ASU,
  majoring in Software Engineering, and also taking a Udemy course on Web Development.
  I don't have many skills on my belt at the moment, however, I have used these in the past:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Java</li>
  <li>PostgreSQL</li>
  <li>C</li>
  <li>C++</li>
  <li>Scheme</li>
  <li>HTML</li>
</ul>
